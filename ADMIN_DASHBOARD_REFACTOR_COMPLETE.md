# Admin Dashboard Refactoring - Complete

## Overview
The AdminDashboard.jsx component has been successfully refactored from a large monolithic component (~2000+ lines) into a modular, maintainable architecture.

## Refactoring Results

### Before
- Single file with 2000+ lines of code
- All functionality mixed together
- Difficult to maintain and extend
- Poor separation of concerns

### After
- Modular component architecture
- Custom hooks for data management
- Reusable modal components
- Clear separation of concerns
- Much easier to maintain and extend

adminAPI.getReservations(params)
adminAPI.getReservationStats(filters)
adminAPI.createReservation(data)
adminAPI.updateReservation(id, data)
adminAPI.deleteReservation(id)
adminAPI.sendInvitation(id)

// Properties (enhanced)
adminAPI.getProperties(withStats)
adminAPI.createRoom(propertyId, data)
adminAPI.updateRoom(id, data)
adminAPI.deleteRoom(id)

// Users (enhanced)
adminAPI.getUserStats()
adminAPI.updateUserRole(id, role)
adminAPI.updateUserStatus(id, isActive)
```

## Technical Improvements
