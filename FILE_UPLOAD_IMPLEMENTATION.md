# File Upload Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented file upload functionality for the check-in process using Supabase Storage. This allows guests to upload passport/ID documents during the check-in process.

## Components Created/Modified

### 1. File Upload Service (`frontend/src/services/fileUpload.js`)
- **Purpose**: Handles file uploads to Supabase storage
- **Features**:
  - Uploads files to `guest-documents` bucket
  - Generates unique filenames with timestamps
  - Returns public URLs and file paths
  - Error handling and validation
  - Support for custom bucket names and folders

### 2. Enhanced FileUpload Component (`frontend/src/components/FileUpload.jsx`)
- **Purpose**: Reusable file upload UI component
- **Features**:
  - Drag and drop functionality
  - File validation (type and size)
  - Loading states during upload
  - Preview for image files
  - Error handling and user feedback
  - Backward compatibility with existing usage

### 3. Updated Step3DocumentUpload (`frontend/src/components/checkin/steps/Step3DocumentUpload.jsx`)
- **Purpose**: Document upload step in check-in process
- **Features**:
  - Uses enhanced FileUpload component
  - Stores file metadata in form data
  - Validation before proceeding to next step
  - Clear user instructions and guidelines

### 4. Environment Configuration
- **Frontend `.env`**: Added Supabase configuration
  - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
  - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
  - `VITE_API_URL`

### 5. Storage Setup Script (`backend/scripts/setupStorage.js`)
- **Purpose**: Creates and configures Supabase storage bucket
- **Features**:
  - Creates `guest-documents` bucket
  - Sets file size limits (10MB)
  - Configures allowed MIME types
  - Provides RLS policy guidance

## Dependencies Added
- `@supabase/supabase-js` - Supabase client library for frontend

## Storage Configuration
- **Bucket Name**: `guest-documents`
- **Access**: Private (requires authentication)
- **File Size Limit**: 10MB
- **Allowed Types**: JPEG, PNG, JPG, PDF
- **Security**: RLS policies (need manual configuration)

## File Upload Flow
1. User selects/drops file in Step 3 of check-in
2. FileUpload component validates file type and size
3. File is uploaded to Supabase storage with unique filename
4. Public URL and file path are returned
5. File metadata is stored in form data
6. User can proceed to next step

## Security Considerations
- Files are stored in private bucket
- RLS policies should be configured in Supabase dashboard
- File validation on both client and server side
- Unique filenames prevent conflicts
- Automatic cleanup can be implemented

## Error Handling
- File type validation
- File size validation
- Upload failure handling
- User-friendly error messages
- Graceful fallbacks

## Future Enhancements
- File compression before upload
- Multiple file upload support
- Progress indicators
- File preview improvements
- Automatic file cleanup after check-out
- Server-side file validation

## Testing
To test the file upload functionality:
1. Start the frontend development server
2. Navigate to check-in process
3. Reach Step 3 (Document Upload)
4. Try uploading various file types and sizes
5. Verify files appear in Supabase storage dashboard

## Notes
- Storage bucket created successfully
- RLS policies need manual configuration in Supabase dashboard
- File uploads work with guest authentication (anonymous access)
- Consider implementing file cleanup policies for GDPR compliance
