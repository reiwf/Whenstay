# Reservation Update Fix - COMPLETED

## Issue Description
The reservation update functionality in the admin dashboard was failing due to a field mapping mismatch between the frontend and backend.

## Root Cause
**Field Mapping Mismatch**: The frontend was sending field names in snake_case format (e.g., `guest_name`, `guest_email`) while the backend PUT endpoint expected camelCase format (e.g., `guestName`, `guestEmail`).

### The Problem Flow:
1. **ReservationModal.jsx** was creating `submitData` with snake_case field names
2. **Backend admin.js PUT endpoint** expected camelCase field names for proper mapping
3. The backend mapping logic failed because it couldn't find the expected camelCase fields
4. Result: Reservation updates were silently failing

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Frontend Fix (ReservationModal.jsx)
**Changed the `submitData` object to use camelCase field names:**

```javascript
// BEFORE (❌ Wrong - snake_case)
const submitData = {
  guest_name: formData.guestName,
  guest_email: formData.guestEmail,
  check_in_date: formData.checkInDate,
  // ...
}

// AFTER (✅ Correct - camelCase)
const submitData = {
  guestName: formData.guestName,
  guestEmail: formData.guestEmail,
  checkInDate: formData.checkInDate,
  phoneNumber: formData.guestPhone,
  checkOutDate: formData.checkOutDate,
  numGuests: parseInt(formData.numGuests),
  numAdults: parseInt(formData.numAdults),
  numChildren: parseInt(formData.numChildren),
  totalAmount: formData.totalAmount ? parseFloat(formData.totalAmount) : null,
  currency: formData.currency,
  status: formData.status,
  roomId: formData.roomId,
  specialRequests: formData.specialRequests,
  bookingSource: formData.bookingSource
}
```

### 2. Backend Enhancement (admin.js)
**Added missing field mappings for new fields:**

```javascript
// Added mappings for fields that were missing
if (updateData.roomId !== undefined) reservationUpdateData.room_id = updateData.roomId;
if (updateData.numAdults !== undefined) reservationUpdateData.num_adults = updateData.numAdults;
if (updateData.numChildren !== undefined) reservationUpdateData.num_children = updateData.numChildren;
if (updateData.specialRequests !== undefined) reservationUpdateData.special_requests = updateData.specialRequests;
if (updateData.bookingSource !== undefined) reservationUpdateData.booking_source = updateData.bookingSource;
```

## Field Mapping Reference

| Frontend Field (camelCase) | Backend Field (snake_case) | Description |
|---------------------------|---------------------------|-------------|
| `guestName` | `guest_name` | Guest full name |
| `guestEmail` | `guest_email` | Guest email address |
| `phoneNumber` | `guest_contact` | Guest phone number |
| `checkInDate` | `check_in_date` | Check-in date |
| `checkOutDate` | `check_out_date` | Check-out date |
| `numGuests` | `num_guests` | Total number of guests |
| `numAdults` | `num_adults` | Number of adults |
| `numChildren` | `num_children` | Number of children |
| `totalAmount` | `total_amount` | Total reservation amount |
| `currency` | `currency` | Currency code |
| `status` | `status` | Reservation status |
| `roomId` | `room_id` | Room ID |
| `specialRequests` | `special_requests` | Special requests |
| `bookingSource` | `booking_source` | Booking source |

## Files Modified

### Frontend
- `frontend/src/components/admin/modals/ReservationModal.jsx`
  - Fixed `submitData` object to use camelCase field names
  - Ensures proper mapping with backend expectations

### Backend
- `backend/routes/admin.js`
  - Added missing field mappings in PUT `/reservations/:id` endpoint
  - Enhanced field mapping coverage for all reservation fields

## Testing
The fix addresses the core issue where:
1. ✅ Frontend now sends camelCase field names as expected by backend
2. ✅ Backend properly maps all fields from camelCase to snake_case for database storage
3. ✅ Reservation updates should now work correctly through the admin interface

## Related to Guest Information Collection
This fix also supports the guest information collection feature by ensuring that when guests submit their information during check-in, the data can be properly updated in the reservations table through the admin interface.

## Status: COMPLETED ✅
The field mapping mismatch has been resolved. Reservation updates should now work correctly in the admin dashboard.
