# Whenstay Database Schema V2 - Implementation Summary

## 🎉 What We've Accomplished

We have successfully designed and implemented a comprehensive database schema migration that transforms the Whenstay property management system from a basic apartment-based structure to a sophisticated property/room management system with Supabase Auth integration.

## 🔄 Key Transformations

### 1. Authentication System Upgrade
**Before (V1):**
- Custom `users` table with password hashing
- Manual authentication management
- Security concerns with password storage

**After (V2):**
- Supabase Auth integration for secure authentication
- `user_profiles` table linked to `auth.users.id`
- Built-in security features (JWT, email verification, OAuth)
- Professional-grade authentication system

### 2. Property Structure Revolution
**Before (V1):**
```
apartments table
├── Single room per apartment
├── Mixed property/room data
└── Limited scalability
```

**After (V2):**
```
properties table (Property Label 01)
├── rooms table (101, 102, 103, ..., 122)
│   ├── Individual access codes
│   ├── Room-specific amenities
│   └── Bed configurations
└── Property-wide amenities and rules
```

### 3. Enhanced Guest Experience
