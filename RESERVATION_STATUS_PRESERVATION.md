# Reservation Status Preservation During Check-in

## Change Summary
Removed automatic reservation status change during online check-in submission to preserve manual status management workflow.

## What Was Changed

### Before
When guests completed online check-in, the system automatically changed the reservation status to 'completed':
```javascript
// Update reservation status to completed
await databaseService.updateReservationStatus(reservation.id, 'completed');
```

### After
The reservation status is now preserved and remains unchanged during check-in submission. Only guest information and check-in data are updated.

## Current Behavior

### During Online Check-in Submission:
✅ **Updated Fields:**
- Guest information (first name, last name, personal email, contact, address)
- Check-in details (estimated time, travel purpose)
- Emergency contact information
- Passport/ID document URL
- Agreement acceptance status
- Check-in submission timestamp (`checkin_submitted_at`)

❌ **NOT Updated:**
- Reservation status (remains as originally set)

### Check-in Detection Logic:
- Check-in completion is detected via the `checkin_submitted_at` field
- Status field is independent of check-in submission
- Admins can manually manage status changes as needed

## Benefits

1. **Workflow Control**: Admins maintain full control over reservation status changes
2. **Audit Trail**: Clear separation between check-in submission and status management
3. **Flexibility**: Status can be managed based on business rules independent of check-in
4. **Data Integrity**: Preserves original reservation workflow and status meanings

## Status Management

Reservation status should now be managed through:
- Admin dashboard manual updates
- Automated business rules (if implemented)
- Integration with property management systems
- Other administrative processes

The online check-in process focuses solely on collecting and storing guest information without affecting the reservation's business status.

## Root Cause of the Error

The error was caused by a database trigger `update_reservations_checkin_status` that automatically executed when the reservations table was updated. This trigger was trying to set the reservation status to "submitted", but "submitted" is not a valid enum value for the `reservation_status` type.

Valid enum values are: `'pending'`, `'invited'`, `'completed'`, `'cancelled'`

## Database Fix Required

To resolve this issue, the problematic trigger must be removed from the database:

```sql
-- Execute this in your Supabase SQL editor
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS update_reservations_checkin_status ON reservations;
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS update_checkin_status();
```

## Files Created/Modified
- `backend/routes/checkin.js` - Removed automatic status update call
- `backend/database/fix_checkin_trigger.sql` - SQL script to remove problematic trigger
- `backend/scripts/fixCheckinTrigger.js` - Node.js script to execute the database fix

## Database Fields Used for Check-in Tracking
- `checkin_submitted_at` - Timestamp when check-in was submitted
- `agreement_accepted` - Boolean for agreement acceptance
- `admin_verified` - Boolean for admin verification status
- All guest information fields (names, contact, documents, etc.)
